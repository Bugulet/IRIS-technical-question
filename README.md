### Technical details

Frontend wise, the project was built using React and it's a single page app for both tasks.

The project uses PrimeReact for styling, which allows for hot-swapping styles ranging from Bootstrap to Tailwind.


Testing was done using the [default react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), the source, tests and everything else you might need is found [here](https://github.com/Bugulet/IRIS-technical-question/tree/main/src)
